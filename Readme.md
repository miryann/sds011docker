# Minimal web interface for SDS011 air quality sensor
This application makes use of a SDS011 nova PM Sensor and visualizes air quality levels in a minimalistic web interface. The sensor is queried for new data every 15 minutes, which is then saved in a MongoDB database. Another container runs a light nodejs-Webapp, that displays the data in a simple chartjs graph. The entire application is dockerized. The project is further explained in this [Medium article.](https://medium.com/@seandlg/building-a-dockerized-minimal-web-interface-for-a-sds011-air-quality-sensor-ab1ea7467e64 "Building a dockerized minimal web interface for a SDS011 air qualityÂ sensor")

## Installation & Usage
### Linux-based OS (x86 instruction set)
Checkout into the `master` branch. Run the app as follows:
1) Connect the sensor to your USB-port & ensure that it is accessible under `/dev/ttyUSB0` (this is standard for many Linux based systems such as Ubuntu)
2) Run `sudo docker-compose up -d` (from within the sds011docker directory; optionally omit the `-d` if you want to see the logging output of the containers)
3) Open a browser and type in "localhost" into the address bar
### Raspbian (ARMv6 instruction set)
Checkout into the `raspberry` branch. Follow instructions there.
